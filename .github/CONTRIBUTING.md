# Contributing to MCreator Fabric Generator

Since we have limited time, we would love to accept pull requests to get things done. We've also put a few ground rules so that pull requests can be maintained easily and follow the same codestyle.

## Contributing to the code
* Keep minor changes like bug fixes and spelling errors a separate commit
* State all your changes
* Do *not* use newline brackets
* Report to us if an automatic merge cannot be performed. If there are conflicts, it is at our discretion to decide what conflicts will be resolved.
* Use descriptive commit messages. A small description of what was done is enough.
* Always annotate client-side methods with `@Environment(Envtype.CLIENT)`
* Always annotate overridden methods with `@Override`
* Follow java naming conventions
* Use the `this` keyword when referencing any non static fields

You must also follow the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/ClothCreators/MCreatorFabricGenerator/blob/1.15.2/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
